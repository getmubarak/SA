## Challenges
- Frequent timeouts from third-party APIs (e.g., Credit Score API).
- The KYC Verification Service from a third-party provider sometimes goes down for several minutes.
- Prevent abuse or exceeding third-party quotas.
- Repeated KYC lookups for the same customer (customer submits many application or make modifications)
- Interacting with external unreliable systems (banks, bureaus, KYC vendors). Many of these interactions may fail or time out.
