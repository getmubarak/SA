A system is robust if it acts reasonably in severe or unusual conditions. It isnot possible to give a precise definition of robustness, but one characteristic of
robust systems is that their specifications include “desired reactions to undesirable situations”

The opposite of robust code is fragile code. The harder it is to create an error of any type or form that the computer cannot handle safely the more robust the software is. program that accepts "pancakes" for a date input and pops up a error box. 

"robustness" describes an application's response to its input  while "fault-tolerance" describes an application's response to its environment.

An app is robust when it can work consistently with inconsistent data. A robust program will accept junk input and not crash. A music player is robust when it can continue decoding an MP3 after encountering a malformed frame. A maps application is robust when it can parse addresses in various formats with various misspellings and return a useful location. 

An app is fault-tolerant when it can work consistently in an inconsistent environment. A database application is fault-tolerant when it can access an alternate shard when the primary is unavailable. A web application is fault-tolerant when it can continue handling requests from cache even when an API host is unreachable. A storage subsystem is fault-tolerant when it can return results calculated from parity when a disk member is offline.
